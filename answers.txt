Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: [It allows one to work on projects with other people remotely and separately. As a result it allows
        for more organization in project workflow, prevents code overwrite mistakes, and allows everyone to know what's the status/being
        worked on all at the same time.]

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: [Data Science can be applied to any field where data generation, accumulation and processing is needed. One example of this is
        Healthcare, where data science can be used to predict disease outbreaks.]

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: [Meging preserves the writing history: adds a merge commit and shows how the branches eventually join. On the other hand,
        rebasing doesn't preserve that history, and moreso rewrites the history to make it linear as though everything happened
        on just one branch.]

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: [I look forward to hopefully gain some experience with research using Computer Science skills, and hopefully getting an 
        internship.]
